- Handle server sending updates faster than UI can render them.
  - Have client ask for another init when too many diffs are buffered.
  - Profile and speed up rendering.
- Reduce overloading of the term "grid". Currently refers to CSS module, HTML element, and backend data structure.
- Try using SVG or canvas instead of HTML div's for grid
- Simplify model. Server only needs to send the cells that changed state, not the new state. Likewise for the client, unless we implement erasing.
- On init, server can send just the live cells, rather than the whole grid, so long as the client can distinguish between an init and a diff.
- Write test for client side code (input: ws; output: document)
- Generate server and client code so that the grid dimensions are defined in one place
- Do the tests leak goroutines?
- For tests in which blocking forever indicates failure, add timeouts to help with debugging
- Pick an appropriate port number.
- Pick appropriate WebSocket buffer sizes to pass to Upgrader. See Gorilla WebSocket documentation.
- Look into using Gorilla WebSocket readJSON and writeJSON methods
- Docker it up so app can run on any OS
