- Make panning with the mouse smoother
- Consider making move button a toggle composed of two buttons stitched together: left side crossed arrows, right side pencil
- Max clients
- Try using canvas instead of divs to speed up rendering
- Try updating only the visible portion of the board to speed up rendering
- On Chrome, if the page loads in the background, we get an error reading property "close" of undefined. This is because the transition to visibility state "hidden" and corresponding call to protocol.ws.disconnect happens before the WebSocket is created via the delayed call to protocol.ws.connect in init().
- On init, server can send just the live cells, rather than the whole grid, so long as the client can distinguish between an init and a diff.
- Automate testing of client-side code
- Transpile JS to support older browsers
- Generate server and client code so that the grid dimensions are defined in one place
- Do the tests leak goroutines?
- Pick appropriate WebSocket buffer sizes to pass to Upgrader. See Gorilla WebSocket documentation.
- Look into using Gorilla WebSocket readJSON and writeJSON methods
- Browser testing with Selenium (or BrowserStack/LambdaTest to hit macOS)
- Continuous deployment
- Design doc. This would be a good place to explain that gol+hub+writePump maintains the order of InitListener and Tick messages, so that the client stays in sync with the server.

Features:

- Zoom +/- buttons. Change layout of controls to [move, zoom-, zoom+, submit], with a caret to expand controls upward, showing species.
- A way to clear debris (eraser, reset button, automatic, ...)
- Fancier cells: rounded, small when empty, large when filled. Potentially animate transitions.
- Nicer font and color palette
- Change state of / animate submit button when board is dirty
- Gene mixing and mutating
- Move controls to the right side of the screen in landscape mode
- Panning with arrow keys
- Langton's Ant
